# BT Navigator

## Modified for Bonsai Robotics for Humble

This is a fork of the BT Navigator to enable navigator plugins for Humble which is an ABI breaking change. Once upgrading to Iron or newer, this is no longer required and you should revert back to the Nav2 BT Navigator version to obtain updates and bug fixes. This is required to use the CoverageNavigator plugin type on a temporary basis.

See Nav2 docs for relevent information.
